brackets-perforce
=================

Perforce extension for brackets.

Extension adds a Checkout option to the context menu.

This allows checkout of a file from a perforce workspace.

The workspace is picked up from the perforce .project file in your project root folder.

When working on a project, you will need to select File / Open Folder and navigate to your perforce root directory.

File is checked out to the default changelist.

Version: 1.1 23-09-2015

Added auto checkout option to Preference service so files can be auto checked out when edited.
